<p>I woke up in the middle of a forest. It was morning. The sun was high up. The sky was bright. Too bright. My eyes were struggling to cope with the harsh light as I got to my feet. I looked at my surroundings and found nothing out of the ordinary. All there was is a bunch of grass, dirt, trees, chickens, pigs, and cows. Wait, chickens, pigs, and cows? I usually don&rsquo;t see these in the wild. I thought they were all kept on farms. And I am quite hungry. Hm. Never mind. I&rsquo;ll think about food later. Right now, something is telling me I need to get some wood for tools. But how am I supposed to get the wood? I have no axe. Out of frustration, I punched a tree. At first, I thought it would hurt like hell, but it was surprisingly not. And when I looked up, expecting to see a bruised or bleeding fist, all I saw was a tiny crack in the wood where my fist made contact. And from then on, I went around to a bunch of trees, taking their logs and turning them into planks. After some time, I came across a village just as night was falling. And after a quick conversation with some of the villagers, they let me sleep in one of their homes. I&rsquo;m going to bed now. Let&rsquo;s see what&rsquo;s going to happen tomorrow.</p>
<p>Signing off,
