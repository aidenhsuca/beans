<p>I think breakfast is a great thing. It&rsquo;s a great way to start your day for one, and two, it&rsquo;s a bunch of food in the morning. And the breakfast items are great as well. And you can virtually have anything. For starters, the regular breakfast items are toast, cereal, fruits, yogurt, eggs, coffee, oatmeal, sausages, bacon, kippers, black pudding, tea, baked beans, hash browns, milk, waffles etc.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care, let me eat whatever I want.&rdquo; type of people. A prime example of one of those types of people is me. Sometimes, I will eat cake, pizza, cookies, overall sugary and generally unhealthy &ldquo;breakfast&rdquo; items. If there was a party or some event that happened the night before resulting in me acquiring these specific foods, then I will usually indulge in them the next morning, without holding back.</p>
<p>I have the mentality of I live to eat, instead of what my mother says, which is &ldquo;You eat to live!&rdquo; whenever I&rsquo;m gorging myself a lot. I think it can work both ways, depending on the context, but I like the former better. Because then, I can use that to excuse myself to get more food at buffets.</p>
<p>When I do use that excuse, I usually beeline towards the desert bar. I get very excited by dessert, or candy, or chocolate, or just sugar that I like. Even though I don&rsquo;t put the other desserts in the same cohort as ice cream, I think they are still pretty great.</p>
<p>Back to breakfast. Breakfast can be something that you can be very passionate about because it is a great topic to discuss. Breakfast is the first meal of the day after your stomach has abstained from it for a whole sleep cycle unless you&rsquo;re the type of person that wakes up in the middle of the night for some snack (not that I have a problem with that. I&rsquo;ve gone and done that quite a few times myself actually). Hence the word, breakfast, which means you break your fast.</p>
<p>Breakfast can be a very energizing and refreshing event in the morning, but it all depends on how the day is going. I, personally, think that all breakfasts should be an exciting beginning to the day, but then again, that&rsquo;s just my opinion. And then again, you can also have your thoughts and views.</p>
<p>Enjoy your future breakfasts!</p>
