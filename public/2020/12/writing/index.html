<p>Hello there. My name is beans and I&rsquo;m going to sit here and write this essay because I need to write an essay and also to waste time. So um, while I&rsquo;m here, I might as well talk about today. I had a pretty good day actually, and it is still pretty good because at the time of writing the day is still not over. My dad is gonna buy me a new mic because it&rsquo;s one that I&rsquo;ve sought after for quite a bit of time now, it&rsquo;s cheap, and it&rsquo;s a good quality microphone. I might get back into making YouTube videos again, with the new equipment, and let&rsquo;s see how it goes. What&rsquo;s funny about my YouTube channel is that through almost no effort at all in the past 8-9 months that I have gotten to 50 subscribers, which is honestly amazing. Another new thing I&rsquo;ve gotten into doing is just saying the word honk randomly. For example, one of my friends will just have discord open on the side while they&rsquo;re playing a game or just chilling, and then they&rsquo;ll randomly see a messages in a mutual server or messages that we have, and it&rsquo;ll just be me saying the word honk. It doesn&rsquo;t always have to be just normal honk, I can also vary it sometimes if it fancies me. Anyhow, my goal for this essay was at least 230 words, and seeing as I have surpassed that goal, I will now end it here.</p>
<p>Bye, and until next time.</p>
