<p>The &ldquo;Wings of Fire&rdquo; are a series of New York Times bestseller books written by Tui T. Sutherland. It is fictional writing about dragons and fantasy, but with a bit more violence. Some of the details are quite gruesome, if I do say so myself. But nevertheless, I am on the last book of the series, so I decided to write a short summary of the first book and the others in order (separate essays of course).</p>
<p>The book is centred around 5 characters, who are dragons. Their names are Clay, Tsunami, Sunny, Glory, and Starflight. These 5 dragons are called the &ldquo;Dragonets of Destiny&rdquo; and it was written in a prophecy that they would end the great dragon war, which has been going on for 18 years now. Those 5 dragonets are different types of dragons, Clay is a MudWing, Tsunami is a SeaWing, Sunny is a SandWing, Glory is a RainWing, and Starflight is a NightWing. All of the dragon species names are IceWing, SkyWing, NightWing, RainWing, SeaWing, MudWing, and SandWing.</p>
<p>These 5 dragons start off under a mountain, being taken away as eggs and left to three dragons named Dune, Webs, and Kestrel. They are part of an organization called the &ldquo;Talons of Peace&rdquo;, who are dedicated to making sure the prophecy is fulfilled so the war can come to an end. The dragonets don&rsquo;t like living underground, as it&rsquo;s not very natural and their guardians are harsh to them. Eventually, they escape, but at the cost of being captured by SkyWing queen Queen Scarlet. Clay, Tsunami, Glory, Sunny, and Starflight are taken as prisoners to the Sky Kingdom, where Clay, Tsunami and Starflight are held in the prisons to be made to fight in the arena for Queen Scarlet&rsquo;s entertainment. The dragonets manage to get out of that pickle with some inside help. The dragonets go on a quest to try to find Clay&rsquo;s family, where he learns some disappointing news. The story then ends when the dragonets decide that they will try to find Tsunami&rsquo;s family.</p>
<p>Each book is written from a different dragonets point of view, meaning most of the book is focused from the eye of an individual dragon. The first book, titled &ldquo;The Dragonet Prophecy&rdquo; is written from Clay&rsquo;s experiences.
The second book is written from Tsunami&rsquo;s, the third book is written from Glory&rsquo;s, the fourth book is written from Starflight&rsquo;s, and the fifth book is written from Sunny&rsquo;s.</p>
