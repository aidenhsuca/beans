              <div>
          I play this game called Star Wars Battlefront II. What is that you ask? Well let me explain.
Battlefront II (can be abbreviated to BF2, but not to be confused with Battlefield 2, which is a different game) is a game featuring a wide variety of modes, and there are two ways to play. First, you can play the story mode, which takes you on a journey through the perspective of individuals amongst the universe at that point of time.

        <div style="font-size: smaller; margin-bottom: 5px">January 2021</div>
              <div>
          Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is a single-player story game that takes you through the life of a Jedi named Cal Kestis, who was a padawan to Jedi Master Jaro Tapal, who was killed during the Jedi Purge, which led to Cal going into hiding and living alone, becoming a scrapper on Bracca, the planet which they were stationed on when Order 66 was issued.
Fallen Order has a very rich story, taking you back to when Cal was still training as a padawan through flashbacks during his journey to rebuild the Jedi Order.

        <div style="font-size: smaller; margin-bottom: 5px">January 2021</div>
              <div>
          The &ldquo;Wings of Fire&rdquo; are a series of New York Times bestseller books written by Tui T. Sutherland. It is fictional writing about dragons and fantasy, but with a bit more violence. Some of the details are quite gruesome, if I do say so myself. But nevertheless, I am on the last book of the series, so I decided to write a short summary of the first book and the others in order (separate essays of course).

              <div>
          Our story starts in a modern day town house, focused on a kid named Aiden. This particular child loved video games, and aspired to be a professional gamer. And a part of that dream was acquiring the best gaming gear he can get. But, since he was only a teenager still depending on his parents, Aiden had to start small. He had it good, no doubt, with an amazing keyboard and mouse, a decent pc, and a decent headset.

              <div>
          Hello there. My name is beans and I&rsquo;m going to sit here and write this essay because I need to write an essay and also to waste time. So um, while I&rsquo;m here, I might as well talk about today. I had a pretty good day actually, and it is still pretty good because at the time of writing the day is still not over. My dad is gonna buy me a new mic because it&rsquo;s one that I&rsquo;ve sought after for quite a bit of time now, it&rsquo;s cheap, and it&rsquo;s a good quality microphone.

              <div>
          Today I will write a short little piece about my keyboard and mouse, and what impact they&rsquo;ve had on me.
My keyboard and mouse are recent additions to my gaming setup, along with my headset, computer and mousepad. Before I got my keyboard and mouse, I was using my dad&rsquo;s crappy office peripherals to play Minecraft. It wasn&rsquo;t the best, but it worked. As time went on, I watched YouTube videos about gaming peripherals, such as the keyboard and mouse I have now.

          The composers that I chose to compare are John Williams and Ludwig van Beethoven. The songs that I chose were &ldquo;The Imperial March&rdquo;, composed by John Williams, and Ode To Joy, which was composed by Ludwig van Beethoven.
Let me start off by talking about John Williams. John Towner Williams was born on February 8, 1932 in Flushing, New York. He is an American composer, conductor, pianist and trombonist. He is also considered the greatest film composer of all time by a great many people.

        <div style="font-size: smaller; margin-bottom: 5px">December 2020</div>
              <div>
          Hamilton is a sung-and-rapped through musical which portrayed the life of Founding Father Alexander Hamilton. The show draws heavily from hip hop, as well as R&amp;B, pop, soul, and traditional show tunes. The show also had non-white actors cast as the Founding Fathers and other historical figures. Lin Manuel Miranda described the musical as &ldquo;America then, as told by America now.&rdquo;
Since the opening on Broadway, Hamilton received critical acclaim. It premiered Off-Broadway, at the Public Theater, on February 17, 2015.

              <div>
          Ah, the majestic sandwich. It is a simple invention, but exquisite. The more known use for it is to consume and sate hunger, but there are other uses as well, such as a projectile in a food fight.
The sandwich originates from 18th-century Europe John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich. He was supposedly the inventor of the sandwich. However, the modern-day sandwich is named after Lord Sandwich, who was a constant gambler and didn&rsquo;t have time to eat proper meals, so he kept asking his servants to bring him slices of meat between two slices of bread.

              <div>
          When a conversation with some people or a subject in class comes to seasons, and I get asked which season I prefer the most, my answer is always winter. I mean, you see the word &ldquo;winter&rdquo; everywhere. For instance, Wintergreen, Winter solstice, Winter season, and that&rsquo;s about all the &ldquo;winter-y&rdquo; things I can think to list. I mean, what&rsquo;s not to like about the cold season? Not the &ldquo;cold&rdquo; season as in the ailment, but cold as in temperature.

          A petition against essays (for me)
So, I have a problem of sorts. Every week, my Dad is compelling me to write an essay about something. It was fine the first time because it was a new thing to do. The second time was also ok, but the excitement was wearing off indefinitely. I did write about breakfast, which was fun, but it took me all week because I didn&rsquo;t enjoy it that much.

              <div>
          I think breakfast is a great thing. It&rsquo;s a great way to start your day for one, and two, it&rsquo;s a bunch of food in the morning. And the breakfast items are great as well. And you can virtually have anything. For starters, the regular breakfast items are toast, cereal, fruits, yogurt, eggs, coffee, oatmeal, sausages, bacon, kippers, black pudding, tea, baked beans, hash browns, milk, waffles etc.
And then there&rsquo;s the &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care, let me eat whatever I want.

          I woke up in the middle of a forest. It was morning. The sun was high up. The sky was bright. Too bright. My eyes were struggling to cope with the harsh light as I got to my feet. I looked at my surroundings and found nothing out of the ordinary. All there was is a bunch of grass, dirt, trees, chickens, pigs, and cows. Wait, chickens, pigs, and cows? I usually don&rsquo;t see these in the wild.
