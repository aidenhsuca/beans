DISCLAIMER: I'm going to dumb everything down here so it's easier to read and understand, for me and you.

Before we start, we have to understand what causes inflammation first. Inflammation occurs when your body's immune cells are fighting something in a part of your body, and those immune cells are sending a signal and amplifying it at the same time to make sure that you are notified and then can go get it checked out. Now that we have that straightened out, let's begin.

Anti-inflammatories are substances or drugs that reduce inflammation of whatever. It's essentially a painkiller. But there is more to it than you think. I mean it sounds plain because it can't get more complicated than being something that reduces inflammation right? Wrong. There is a bit more to it than I thought as well. 

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), Antileukotrienes, and Immune selective anti-inflammatory derivatives (ImSAIDs) are some, to name a few. Some other things aren't drugs but have anti-inflammatory effects.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs):     
This type of anti-inflammatory drug help eases the pain by countering an enzyme that synthesizes a compound, therefore causing pain. What the NSAID does is prevents the enzyme from ever synthesizing the compound, reducing or eliminating pain.

Antileukotrienes:     
These are agents that act as enzyme inhibitors, meaning they attach themselves to enzymes and decrease the enzyme's activities. However, antileukotrienes only provide anti-inflammatory effects and have no pain-relieving effects. Even though they don't have pain-relieving effects, they are mainly used for treating diseases relating to inflammation of the lungs (asthma) as well as sinus inflammations.

Immune selective anti-inflammatory derivatives (ImSAIDs):   
These are a new class of peptides (some amino acid thingy. Too complicated ._.) that are being researched as a new class of anti-inflammatories that have diverse biological properties, including anti-inflammatory properties. These are supposed to manipulate the activation and migration of inflammatory cells, which are immune cells amplifying the inflammatory signal.

Bioactive compounds:   
Bioactive compounds had found some success by showing anti-inflammatory activities in albino rats, or lab rats. Some essential oils and extracts that are taken from condiment plants have been found to produce anti-inflammatory effects. 

Ice treatment:   
Ice is an all-rounder, and it is a favourite of school nurses. But applying ice or even cool water to a skin surface injury has been shown to alleviate pain and produce anti-inflammatory effects. The cold temperature chokes the blood circulation and reduces swelling and/or pain.

I know there are more out there, but I think I have done a sufficient job in explaining how anti-inflammation works and providing some examples of it.
