So, my dad recently purchased a down jacket from Eddie Bauer, and he was pretty perplexed as to what the labels were stating. When I had cut them off my jacket, I thought nothing of it and left it on a countertop out of carelessness. But my dad saw them and thought, "I can turn this into an essay!" And now here I am, poised to do research and explain what the labels mean.

I'll start off by explaining what down is, then move on to the labels. Down feathers, commonly known as just down, are the inner feathers of a duck that they use to keep warm. The feathers that you see on the outside of a ducks skin are there for repelling water and such, as they are tougher. Very young ducks start off with only wearing down, then eventually grow out their feathers.

The first thing it says on the label to the left is _80/20 down/feather._ When I looked this up, I learned that this was a ratio of down to feathers. This means that this jacket is of good quality because the article I read says that the less feather count you have compared to down, the higher quality jacket it is. This is because goose/duck down does a better job at trapping air than feathers, keeping you well insulated. So the best down-feather ratio you can get is 90/10 because that has the least amount of feathers and more in favour of down. This type of quality can find this quality of insulation in brands like North Face or Moncler, and if a jacket doesn't say what the down-feather ratio is for that coat, you can assume it's less than 80/20 standard for high-quality winter coats.

The next thing was _fill power._ Essentially, the fill power of down is the amount of space that a single ounce of down occupies. So, for example, my jacket has a 650 fill power, meaning I have one ounce of 650 fill power down(One ounce of 650 fill means that if you took out all the stuffing in the jacket you would get 650 cubic inches of fluffy stuff. For a physical reference, it's about a large snowboot box). So the fill powers range from 300-900, 300 being the lowest, for like fall jackets or something, and 900 being the absolute best. 900 fill power is rare because it is costly to buy and produce. 700-900 fill power jackets are made for extreme conditions, like going to Antarctica or where a regular winter jacket won't cut it. 550-650 fill power jackets are the best middle ground coats, basically standard winter jackets that can keep you warm for negative temperatures. The levels of warmth you are looking for by fill power looks like this: 
550 and below - Not made for sub-zero temperatures
550-650 - Middle ground jacket; good quality for temperatures below 0
650-900 - Very expensive but very warm; hard to find, but North Face makes some at a high cost.

The third thing is _turbidity._ Turbidity helps determine if there is any dust and dirt in the down. How it's decided is the down is soaked and agitated in pure water, then measured for clarity. The standards require it to be at least 300 mm to be sold. Very clean down samples are registered at 550 or higher. My jacket's turbidity count is 800 mm. It's basically the measurement of the opacity in a water sample to see how dirty large particles are. So they're dunking the filling into water and shaking it to see how much dust or dirt come out from the feathers.
