"Congratulations on being the 100 billionth person to die! As a reward, you get to customize your body, choose your skills, traits, etc., for your next reincarnation! Once you finish, click "REINCARNATE."

Was what emanated from an unknown source. I looked around, and all I saw was a computer with all the different customizable options described to me. The voice wasn't kidding. It had ALL the possibilities of the human body. From head to toe, the entire human anatomy was laid out in front of me on the screen. I even saw that I had the option to be born with particularly enhanced genetics in some places, such as heightened senses or sharper vision. It all seemed very interesting, and I could be reborn as a super specimen, but the aspect of being the source of scientific research didn't appeal to me much. I sat there pondering what choices I should make, considering I had thousands and thousands of options to choose from, and I had my entire body to customize. 

When I was in my prime, I thought back to trying and figuring out what form to take. I thought back to when I was a baby, still figuring out what my surroundings were. I was very clueless, but my life's baby phase might go faster if I altered some genetics. But I was still questioning what I wanted to be. My mind was still marvelling about the fact that I got this chance, which was literally a one in a one hundred billion chance.
At one point in my thoughts, I realized that the voice never mentioned a time limit on how long I had to choose, so I kept thinking. 

Every time I came up with a favourable form, I immediately saw some downsides. Every time I imagined I had found a perfect shape, it didn't seem right. So I sat there, drowning in my own ideas. My head was being suffocated in a smorgasbord of imaginative boulders that rolled in and out of my brain. So I decided the only way I was going to get this done was as if I thought of this as one of my school assignments as if this was some type of essay or list, except that the mark I get is my entire life, and if I didn't get this done I would be stuck here. 

After a few years had passed, after every day, meticulously tinkering with every tiny crevice, every nook and cranny of my body to what I thought was suitable, I let go of the mouse and keyboard. Tweaking all the muscles and bones and organs and cells of and even the entire map of my DNA was a very revealing process. I learned all the inside outs of my system, and every time I changed one part of my body, my instinct was to worry if that change would affect another part of my body. As I confidently gazed at my final draft, I started to ask myself, "Is this who I really want to be?" Because the final result was my exact physical features, with my own measure of internals. I had gone through multiple outfits before, such as being a perfect physical specimen, with everything at its very best, even my brain. I had tried to recreate people I had seen in my past, but that might've been awkward because if by chance, the person I assumed the shape of interacted with me, there would be a very uncomfortable conversation.

After what I thought was okay, after another year of tweaking, after scrolling through all the millions of options, I looked at my work. It was, in no other words, an average person. It was practically the same as my past self, but everything was slightly changed, so it altered my physical features and internal and mental state by a margin. But I realized I had one more option. At the very bottom of the list, under all the clickable variables, under all the dropdowns, and under all the sliders, was a unique button that applied precisely what I described it as. It applied uniqueness to the body. After passing another few months in deep thought, I scrolled down all the way to the bottom.

With uncertainty and excitement, I trepidatiously pressed "Randomize."
