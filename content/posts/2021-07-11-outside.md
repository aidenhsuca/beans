Yesterday night was  
An exhilarating night  
Filled with happenings

It all started when  
My friend Martin asked if I  
Wanted to go out

And possibly play  
Basketball among other  
Nice activities

Along with some more  
Friends that lived close to us that  
Would be willing to

Make the journey and  
Meet up on my street at a  
Set time to avoid any

Inconvenience  
That could possibly occur  
To any of us

But then a delay  
Stopped everything in its tracks  
Martin had said that

He would be late as  
His vaccine appointment was  
Scheduled to take place

At the meetup time  
However, my friend Solly  
Was not aware of

The sudden changes,  
Meaning he arrived at my  
Street when neither

Me nor Alekh, who  
(Was another friend of us)  
Were outside to greet

Our friend Solly-man.  
So Solomon went home after   
Searching for Alekh

After he went home,  
Me and Alekh went outside  
because I had seen

Solly go by my  
Street while I was looking out  
My window at night

I shall post the next  
Part of this haiku next week  
On Sunday at night
