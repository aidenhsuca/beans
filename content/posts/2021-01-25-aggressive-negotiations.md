So, I play on a Minecraft server with my friends, and we may or may not have factions in the server. The whitelisted player's number to only 7 of us, with me, Stef, and Ken being the most active, while Mark, Alex, Martin and Angelica aren't as seen as we are. We did add a new member today, Arianna, so we now have eight members apart of the server.

Anyways, the point is that for quite a bit of time, the land has seen some ravaging, ranging from war to arson. But recently, things have calmed down a bit, and I am a new landowner. Yup, that's right. What happened was Ken, the server owner, decided to build a sky base, and I thought, "Why shouldn't I claim the land? I have every right to, don't I?" So I organized a conference between Ken and me to discuss the transfer of land. Stef was also there because she wanted to, and she did try to help, but it didn't matter because Stef didn't have any power. She was like a child trying to make their parents give them 100 dollars, or like France in World War II.  

Now, this is where the story starts. Today, Stef built a "diplomatic center" for negotiations, war laws, trials, a Geneva Convention, etc. Then, we all gathered today and logged into the server. Everyone convened in the "Dip center" we call it, short for Diplomatic Center. For the first few minutes, we had some rough patches before commencing with the talks. It was all trivial matters, such as a hole in the glass behind where I was sitting. 

Then came the serious part. The book and quill were ready to be used and procured by Stef. Then I started by writing the statement in the book and addressing what was to be discussed. After, I handed it to Stef so she could read it, and then it was handed to Ken. Before we parleyed, I was thinking it might involve an armed conflict, where we have to fight him to own the land. Well, we might not look in the good here, but we had reasons to think that. However, during the viewing of the terms, I felt the need to speed up the process and intimidate Ken by pointing my crossbow at his face, but Stef told me to lower my weapon and let Ken finish peacefully. We had a little back and forth about the terms, we finally agreed. I would own the land below his house, on the condition that we would congregate another time and establish laws in the event of a war breaking out. When I say war, I mean a continued conflict between 2 or more members of the server, but we say war cause it sounds cooler. 

Moving on, we all signed the book and it was handed to me. So I am now the proud owner of all the land as far as the eye can see. Stef also co-owns it I suppose, but I have a few plans in the future regarding her status and position on it... And thus we all went about our businesses, having fun on the server before we all logged off.

Hope you enjoyed that recount from earlier today.
