DISCLAIMER: THIS IS ALL FICTION

Death is the only unbiased force in all of creation...or it was. Now, Death is starting to play favourites, reaping some on the slightest pretext while sparing others after the most horrific fates. As the world's only licensed theotherapist, it's up to me to figure out why, and how to fix it. 

 At first, I thought people were joking. But when I was shown proof that Death was playing favourites I thought to myself, "Well this is going to be hard." But my studies had me prepared for a situation like this, in case of a supernatural power gone awry. The first thing I had to do was devise a plan:

Step One - Prepare the proper material and theorize why Death had turned into this.

Step Two - Figure out the best possible answers to why he has gone evil and study the proper way to rectify it.

Step Three - Go over situations and scenarios that could aid in turning Death back to the right path. 

Step Four - Find Death, which is quite easy, because I've spoken to them before and I know they're too lazy to change residences. 

Step Five - Execute my plan and successfully convince Death to stop playing favourites. 

Step Six - Get paid.

And that's the plan! Simple right? Well, no. See, if Death used to be unbiased, then something unreasonable happened to make this big of a change in them. Most of this plan depends on luck, and if I catch Death in a good mood or not. I made sure to go on a Thursday, because I know that's the day Death takes off and doesn't do anything, while the prime days of his activity would be the weekend, and I didn't want to interrupt his "fun," which could put him in a bad mood. 

I have a week to make sure I have the best notes to help them through whatever they're going through, that is if they are going through something. As you can tell, it's a big deal, because while I was out on a walk to clear my mind I saw someone jay-walk and then in an instant they were turned into a pile of blue rocks. That freaked me out pretty badly, but it also hardened my resolve on making sure Death goes back to normal, otherwise that pedestrian would've been rockified for nothing. 

After about a week of non-stop prep, I was ready to head up to Death's cave, where he sits on a throne unjustly judging people. As I was waiting in the lobby for Death's elevator, I noticed that the elevator seemed to be stuck on the 420th floor. That was odd, considering there were only 2 floors in Death's residence, one where he lives and one where he plays video games. Then it dawned on me that I was getting trolled, so I yelled out, "GIVE ME THE ELEVATOR ALREADY!" I promptly heard a ding and the elevator doors opened with a sign that said, "hehe lol" 

After kicking the sign in exasperation and going up to Death's main floor, I stepped out and I just saw Death there, being a dude. The last time I spoke to them, they were being all high and mighty with a crown and robe and staff and it goes on and on. This time I popped in on Death listening to music. I asked them, "What's up?" and "Not much" was the response I got. 'Not much' was an understatement considering what they've been doing for the past 2 months. So I decided to get it over and done with.

"OK let's cut to the chase man. Why have you been screwing people over for no reason and letting the bad ones go?" And after all the counselling notes, scenarios, situations, and stress I've been through, you know the answer I got? You know what? Death looked at me dead in the eye (no pun intended) and said, "Oh I'm just trolling dude lmao. I'll stop :D" 

I don't know how they said that in real life, with a smiley face and everything, but I just stared at him for a second and then left, feeling numb. Death called after me, "You ok dude?" I just ignored them, went home, and conveniently passed out right by the couch.
