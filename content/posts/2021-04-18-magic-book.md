I was in a magic book store, and I left my wallet somewhere, and now I have only $20 to dig through the discount section. That is not good. I  don't know exactly how much of a "discount" a discount is in a Magic book store, mainly because I haven't seen a price yet. 

Turns out it really is a discount section, because everything here is under 10 dollars! That's great! Hopefully, I can buy something that helps me find the wallet that still enables me to buy a pizza. I can taste it right now. A large, warm, succulent pepperoni pizza. Hot, melted cheese, and soft, supported by a firm yet supple dough. I should stop thinking about pizza. I'm making myself hungry and I'm forgetting about the task on hand. Need to find a book that aids me in locating a lost wallet. This had better go swimmingly, otherwise, I'm going to be hungry, cranky, and down $69.

Anyways, I need to get a move on. There are literally 20 shelves of books in the discount section. WHY?!?!?!? IT'S THE DISCOUNT SECTION. Ah well, what can you do? Ah yes, I found the "Retracing your steps and finding lost things" section, which sounds oddly specific. But, the good thing is that there is an isle for that, so that's where I'm headed. 

I finally found a book, titled "How to find lost items for dummies" Sounds a little degrading, but that's alright. Oh great, it's $5. Ok, hopefully, this will work like a charm. I spent 30 minutes looking for this book, that was right at the end of one of the longest shelves in the store. Ok, this is BS. Now there's a line at the cashier, and there's only one cashier. Amazing. This feels like something in a run-of-the-mill comedy show about some guy that makes dumb mistakes on a daily basis. I suppose the only thing besides cutting the line is to wait out the line, and that's boring and my patience is being tested big time. Oh wow, the line is moving at 1 customer per hour. How long can this possibly take? People are buying a few books, not bulk shopping at Costco, which moves surprisingly fast with great efficiency. Back to the point. BORING. I'm going to just tune out and go back to thinking about pizza.

Well, it's officially been 5 hours since I queued up to check out, and that's pretty much a third of my day gone! This sucks. But it's finally my turn now, so I can happily buy my book and get the hell outta here. Oh man, this guy must not have done his homework, because he's taking forever to count out my change. This is probably why the line has been moving at a snail's pace. But it's whatever, he gave me my $15 and I just realised it's only $13. Man, this guy is making me miserable. But it's fine, I got the correct amount of change now, and I'm heading outside to see how to find my wallet. 

So it turns out that the book is a spell that locates your lost item immediately by giving you a mental compass, a slight ringing when you're too far away, and a soft pinging noise when you're close. It also highlights the object when you're close, which I think is pretty neat. Ok, why is there a very prominent pinging noise in my ear. And why is my pocket highlighted? Oh great. Oh, thanks. Oh, wow. This is amazing. I just paid $5 to find something that's in my pocket. And now I'm reading on the back that it says this is one-time use. And now it's poofed and gone. This day is going very well for me if you can't tell. I'm just going to go home and order some pizza. I'm so done with this crap.
