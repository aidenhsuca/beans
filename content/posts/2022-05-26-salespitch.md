Hello, I am here to show you this amazing product, called the 
paperweight. A paperweight is an ingenious object, and you can probably guess the purpose from its name. That's right, it's a weight for your papers. No, it's not supposed to help your paper get fit, it weighs them down.

Let me paint you a picture. It's a hot summer day, and you're working with a bunch of papers on your desk. While working, the heat in the room starts to become insufferable. So you decide to crack open a window to relieve the heat stress. But the cool breeze from the window comes through, picking up your papers and blowing them off the desk.	That's where the paperweight comes in. Once you take the paperweight and put it on top of your stack of papers, voila! No more papers flying off the desk. 

The paperweight provides a reliable way to stop your papers from flying away and puts your mind at ease about your important documents, like taxes, mortgages, adoption papers, etc. It can even be used to hold down receipts and lottery tickets!

Now comes the biggest question. The price. Since it's such a small object with not much fragility, it will only be $7. Any takers?
