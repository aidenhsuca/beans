The composers that I chose to compare are John Williams and Ludwig van Beethoven. The songs that I chose were "The Imperial March", composed by John Williams, and Ode To Joy, which was composed by Ludwig van Beethoven. 

Let me start off by talking about John Williams. John Towner Williams was born on February 8, 1932 in Flushing, New York. He is an American composer, conductor, pianist and trombonist. He is also considered the greatest film composer of all time by a great many people. John Williams has composed some of the most famous film scores for movies, such as the Star Wars saga, Jaws, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Superman, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Home Alone, the Indiana Jones movies, the first two Jurassic Park movies, Schindler's List, and the first three Harry Potter movies. Williams has also composed a number of classical concertos and other pieces of music for orchestral ensembles and solo instruments. He has also worked with movie director Steven Spielberg since 1974, composing music for all but five of his movies. Other works by Williams include theme music for the 1984 Summer Olympic Games, NBC Sunday Night Football, "The Mission" theme used by NBC News and Seven News in Australia, the television series Lost in Space and Land of the Giants, and the incidental music for the first season of Gilligan's Island. He has composed the score for eight of the top 25 highest-grossing movies at the U.S. box office. His work has influenced other movie composers and contemporary classical and popular music. John Williams has won 25 Grammy Awards, seven British Academy Film Awards, five Academy Awards, and four Golden Globe Awards.

Ludwig van Beethoven was born in December 1770, in Bonn, Germany. He was a German composer and pianist. Beethoven remains one of the most admired composers in the history of Western music, as his works ranks amongst the most performed classical music pieces. His works span the transition from the classical period to the romantic era in classical music. His career has been divided into early, middle, and late periods. The "early" period of his career, in which he was developing his skill, is typically considered to have lasted until 1802. From 1802 to 1812, the "middle" period of his career showed a unique path from the "classical" styles of Joseph Haydn and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and this choice is sometimes characterized as "heroic". It was during this time when Beethoven began to suffer from deafness. During the "late" period of his career, which was from 1812 to the time of his death, he lengthened his innovations in musical form and expression. 

Ode To Joy was originally written in German, so here are the German lyrics and then the English translation. This is the link to listen to it: https://youtu.be/ChygZLpJDNE

Lyrics: (German) 

"An die Freude"
Freude, schöner Götterfunken,
Tochter aus Elysium,
Wir betreten feuertrunken,
Himmlische, dein Heiligtum!
Deine Zauber binden wieder
Was die Mode streng geteilt;
Alle Menschen werden Brüder
Wo dein sanfter Flügel weilt.

Wem der große Wurf gelungen
Eines Freundes Freund zu sein;
Wer ein holdes Weib errungen
Mische seinen Jubel ein!
Ja, wer auch nur eine Seele
Sein nennt auf dem Erdenrund!
Und wer's nie gekonnt, der stehle
Weinend sich aus diesem Bund!

Freude trinken alle Wesen
An den Brüsten der Natur;
Alle Guten, alle Bösen
Folgen ihrer Rosenspur.
Küsse gab sie uns und Reben,
Einen Freund, geprüft im Tod;
Wollust ward dem Wurm gegeben
und der Cherub steht vor Gott.

Froh, wie seine Sonnen fliegen
Durch des Himmels prächt'gen Plan
Laufet, Brüder, eure Bahn,
Freudig, wie ein Held zum siegen.

Seid umschlungen, Millionen!
Diesen Kuß der ganzen Welt!
Brüder, über'm Sternenzelt
Muß ein lieber Vater wohnen.
Ihr stürzt nieder, Millionen?
Ahnest du den Schöpfer, Welt?
Such' ihn über'm Sternenzelt!
Über Sternen muß er wohnen.

This is the English translation: 

"Ode To Joy"
Joy, beautiful spark of Divinity [or: of gods],
Daughter of Elysium,
We enter, drunk with fire,
Heavenly one, thy sanctuary!
Thy magic binds again
What custom strictly divided;*
All people become brothers,*
Where thy gentle wing abides.

Whoever has succeeded in the great attempt,
To be a friend's friend,
Whoever has won a lovely woman,
Add his to the jubilation!
Yes, and also whoever has just one soul
To call his own in this world!
And he who never managed it should slink 
Weeping from this union!

All creatures drink of joy
At nature's breasts.
All the Just, all the Evil
Follow her trail of roses.
Kisses she gave us and grapevines,
A friend, proven in death.
Salaciousness was given to the worm 
And the cherub stands before God.

Gladly, as His suns fly
through the heavens' grand plan 
Go on, brothers, your way,
Joyful, like a hero to victory.

Be embraced, Millions!
This kiss to all the world!
Brothers, above the starry canopy
There must dwell a loving Father.
Are you collapsing, millions?
Do you sense the creator, world?
Seek him above the starry canopy!
Above stars must He dwell.

Now I will compare the two songs. Firstly, Ode To Joy was written and still remains to this day as a protest anthem and a celebration of music. Ode To Joy is part of the classical music genre, while Imperial March is part of the film soundtrack genre. Imperial March is one of the best known symphonic movie themes, and it is an example of a leitmotif, which is a recurrent theme associated with characters or events in drama. Ode To Joy is seen as the greatest of Beethoven's work by numerous critics and musicologists. It is also considered one of the supreme achievements in the history of music.
