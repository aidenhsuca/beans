Yesterday morning, my dad went to fill gas. It wasn't anything unusual, just the need to top up the fuel tank.  But when my dad got back to the grocery store he told me about the increased gas prices. My dad told me that the regular gas he paid for was $1 per litre, so he paid around $50 to fill up his tank. But when he paid for the fuel this time around he paid about $75. The price had gone up to $1.5 per litre. Then he asked me why I thought that the price had risen. I tried giving him some wishy-washy answers, but then he told me about the war happening in Ukraine and the effect it had on the gas prices. 

After doing some reading, I gathered that Canada had put sanctions on Russian exports, including oil, while there has been a surge in demand for oil in Canada, but with fewer supplies. Gas prices have also been on the rise in America, with West Texas oil going from US$96 to US$100 per barrel, and Brent Crude oil price has decreased a little bit, going from US$105 to US$103 per barrel. Another thing is, OPEC (The organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) is mainly led by Russia and Saudi Arabia, so if Joe Biden decides to put pressure on Saudi Arabia to produce more fuel, this may upset Putin even more and he could decide to shut down the supply completely. 

Roger McKnight, chief petroleum analyst at En-Pro Internation Inc. said he expects gas prices to rise by 5 cents a litre. He also recommended for the weekly fillers to top up their tank before Saturday, but if you're a daily filler there's little to nothing you can do about this. Even leading up to the Russia-Ukraine war, the high oil demand has been surging the prices for weeks. Dan McTeague, President of Canadians for Affordable Energy, estimated gas prices to be around CA$1.65 per litre by the end of 2022, however since the worsening of the situation in Ukraine the estimation is now to be well above CA$2 per litre.

Canada meanwhile stated on Thursday that they would put more sanctions on Russia, including halting all export permits, as well as financial penalties targeting banks, lawmakers and elites, even though Russia said that any attempt to interfere from other powers would result in Russia retaliating.
