  This essay interprets the song _Gangsta's Paradise_ by _Coolio_ featuring _LV_.

> As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death  
> I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left  
> 'Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long that  
> Even my momma thinks that my mind is gone  
 
This verse gives me an idea already as to what the song is about. Even the title of the song is very revealing. I think it is talking about the life of a gangster and what it's trying to say. 

> But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it    
> Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of  
> You better watch how you talkin' and where you walkin'  
> Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk  

This verse is getting a bit more in-depth, and I can see that this is talking about how a gangster has dealt with killing or harming others before. The last two lines _"You better watch how you talkin' and where you walkin' 
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk"_ Here, he's saying that if he gets mistreated, then whoever did it has to carry themselves very carefully; otherwise, he might kill them and their friends. _Lined in chalk_ implies the idea of being found as a corpse and lined in chalk, like in the movies.

> I really hate to trip, but I gotta loc  
> As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke  
> Fool, I'm the kinda G the little homies wanna be like  
> On my knees in the night, sayin' prayers in the streetlight  

I don't know what to say here, but it seems as if the gangster is getting tired of this lifestyle and are trying to think of ways to free themselves from it. 

> Been spendin' most their lives  
> Livin' in a gangsta's paradise  
> Been spendin' most their lives  
> Livin' in a gangsta's paradise  
> Keep spendin' most our lives  
> Livin' in a gangsta's paradise  
> Keep spendin' most our lives  
> Livin' in a gangsta's paradise  

This is the refrain of the song, and it is repeated three times throughout the whole song, either because it's long or because Coolio is trying to drive home a point. So I think here it's saying that once you get wrapped in the life of a gang, then it's hard to get out, and you spend most of your life in it.

> Look at the situation they got me facing  
> I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the street  
> So I gotta be down with the hood team  
> Too much television watchin', got me chasing dreams  

This stanza is just saying what happened for him to get into this situation, and that he was raised that way, and that he has wasted his time.

> I'm a educated fool with money on my mind  
> Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye  
> I'm a loc'd out gangsta, set trippin' banger  
> And my homies is down, so don't arouse my anger  

This verse tells me that he did spend time studying and going to school to get an education, but he was thinking of easy ways to earn money. According to my research, the _"Ten"_ in his hand could either be a ten-dollar bill, or a Mac-10, which is a submachine gun, commonly used in the gang setting, as it's small and easy to use in driveby's or firefights. And from additional research, _LOC_ could mean _"Love Only Crips"_, because I had read that Coolio had spent time with the Mona Park Crips in Compton. 

> Fool, death ain't nothin' but a heartbeat away  
> I'm livin' life do or die, what can I say?  
> I'm 23 now but will I live to see 24?  
> The way things is going I don't know  

Here I think it's clear that being a gang member is very dangerous. It's as if you can get shot at any time, and your guard always has to be up. _"I'm 23 now but will I live to see 24?"_ is implying that one day he might die if he keeps up this way of life.

> Tell me why are we so blind to see  
> That the ones we hurt are you and me?  

I'm not sure what I can get from these two lines, but it could be saying that being a gang member is harmful to yourself and others around you.

> Been spendin' most their lives  
> Livin' in a gangsta's paradise  
> Been spendin' most their lives  
> Livin' in a gangsta's paradise  
> Keep spendin' most our lives  
> Livin' in a gangsta's paradise  
> Keep spendin' most our lives  
> Livin' in a gangsta's paradise  

This is just the chorus again.

> Power and the money, money and the power  
> Minute after minute, hour after hour  
> Everybody's runnin', but half of them ain't lookin'  
> It's going on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cookin'  

I can't figure out what is trying to be expressed here, but it seems like everyone that's gang-affiliated is trying to pursue something that they might not want or they don't know.

> They say I gotta learn, but nobody's here to teach me  
> If they can't understand it, how can they reach me?  
> I guess they can't, I guess they won't  
> I guess they front, that's why I know my life is out of luck, fool  

This verse sounds like he's communicating that everything is lost. Like he's given up because he's realized there's no one to help him and that he'll keep continuing in the gang until he dies or something else happens. 

> Been spendin' most their lives  
> Livin' in a gangsta's paradise  
> Been spendin' most their lives  
> Livin' in a gangsta's paradise  
> Keep spendin' most our lives  
> Livin' in a gangsta's paradise  
> Keep spendin' most our lives  
> Livin' in a gangsta's paradise  

Chorus again

> Tell me why are we so blind to see  
> That the ones we hurt are you and me?  
> Tell me why are we so blind to see  
> That the ones we hurt are you and me?  

Same two lines again.

That was it, and I hope you enjoyed it.
