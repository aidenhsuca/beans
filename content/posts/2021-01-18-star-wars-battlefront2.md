I play this game called Star Wars Battlefront II. What is that you ask?
Well let me explain.

Battlefront II (can be abbreviated to BF2, but not to be confused with Battlefield 2, which is a different game) is a game featuring a wide variety of modes, and there are two ways to play. First, you can play the story mode, which takes you on a journey through the perspective of individuals amongst the universe at that point of time. The online play is, well, online. You can join and queue into different varieties that online mode has to offer with your friends or strangers. 
They are all different and similar in different aspects, and it also give you the option to choose timelines, meaning you can play modes like Supremacy during the Age of the Republic, Age of the Empire, or Age of the Resistance. 

Whatever game you join, it is teeming with potential to help you become better at the game while enabling you to have fun, as the mechanics and different abilities that come with whatever you play always adds some thrill to the battle.

This was a little short, but I think it gets the idea across. I fully recommend this game to everyone and until January 21st, it will be free for people to download and play on the Epic Games store. 

And as always, may the force be with you.
