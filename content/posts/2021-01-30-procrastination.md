Procrastination. It's like sleep, you don't think you want to do it, and then BAM. The inevitable happens. The procrastination has finally caught up to you, and that's not good. 

Procrastination is also like a shark in Jaws. Except, you never know when it's going to creep up on you because there's no shark theme or whatever you want to call it. And it sucks a lot when the realization hits because you realize that there has been a deep hole dug beneath your feet. What happens with that hole is that it widens the less notice of the hole is taken. That, in my opinion, is procrastination.

I have fallen victim to that countless times, and I'm sure the millions of people out there have experienced this as well. Whether it's getting to your homework (my main killer), doing your chores (my other devil), doing some work, etc. The list is nearly endless. Procrastination can even come in small forms like not wanting to wake up, which happens to me every morning. 

Because I'm still a kid in elementary school, there isn't too much I should be worried about with school, cause the homework I get now isn't troubling, when I'm IN school. And I mean real school, not online learning,  being in school counts as attending a zoom or google meet. The scary thing is, you would think that homework is easier to complete when everything is online right? That's what I thought as well. Now I will tell you what my conclusion was.

 WRONG.  On so many levels was that assumption wrong. At least for me. I don't know if many people notice, but I'm not a very hard worker. For example, I procrastinate with my essays every week. My dad says the deadline is Sunday night, but I dilly-dally all week and end up rushing it. I sometimes don't even get it finished on Sunday, and it carries over to Monday!

So that's exactly what I'm talking about with online learning homework.  During the first week of online learning, the week after Christmas break, abruptly jarred me back from the bliss of constant relaxation to reality. I had school. Online. 

In the first week of online learning, my teacher assigned us homework every day, with no specific due date. So I did the first day of work on Monday, handed it in and practically blew off the rest, telling myself "Today I'm going to finish all my work". Which didn't happen. Then Friday came, and he announced that if he didn't see work coming in the next Monday, he was going to start contacting our parents or something. I forget. Anyways, I started to panic. Because I had 4 days of unfinished work sitting in the google classroom, and it needed to be done. Friday and Saturday passed, and it still wasn't done. Sunday had arrived, and in the morning I convinced myself I was going to knuckle down and do all of it in the afternoon. As you can probably guess, I didn't do it. At this point, all of it sort of became an amorphous blob of words and questions and numbers sitting in cyberspace. So we had dinner, and then I went downstairs to work. Normally, on the weekend, I like to watch t.v. after dinner. But on that fateful Sunday, I spent a whole 2 and a half hours catching up on all that homework until 10:30 pm. 

Thankfully, it all went off without a hitch, and from then on I have learned to try NOT to procrastinate with homework. Emphasis on the "try".
