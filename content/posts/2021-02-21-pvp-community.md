The Minecraft PvP community is a smorgasbord of unique players who all form a wholesome yet violent bunch. It is quite possibly one of the most complicated areas of Minecraft yet. In this essay, I delve into a topic that might be unfamiliar to many of my readers, so I will try my best to make it comprehensible. (Please note that whatever I am stating is all in a video game, don't take it seriously.)

Minecraft PvP, which means player versus player, is a community built around all variations of players beating each other up in a block game. Whether it's with their fists or with a sword, it all comes down to the finer points and strategies of combat. 

One might find themselves listening to an experienced fighter talking about w-tapping and start wondering, "What the hell are they talking about?" That, my friend, is just some of the lingo you will find in the community. In short, w-tapping is a pvp technique.

Now, there will always be people in the world trying to shortcut things, so hacks are coded for that reason. Hacks are implements that people can buy or download to get unfair advantages against other players in matches. A few common hacks are kill aura, scaffold, and bhop. Kill aura gives you the ability to fly around WHILE still dealing damage to your opponent, leaving them in a discombobulated array and trying to figure out what kind of behemoth can spasm around them. Scaffold is when players place blocks at an alarming accuracy and speed to get to opponents faster than a typical player. Bhop is short for "Bunny Hop," enabling you to jump higher distances and achieve incredible speeds. 

After glossing over the cheating content, I will now be arriving at the point where I dishearten the urge to hack. First of all, why? Hacking ruins the game for everyone, and it's no fun to lose to a hacker. Second, downloading hacks off a sketchy website might contain malicious software or a virus that might take your personal info or inject a trojan virus into the pc. So please don't hack. 

The people in the pvp community can be toxic or wholesome. You might find someone that is the devil incarnate, someone that's just a kid, or someone that is hopeless in the fact of jitter-clicking sharks. There are also the sweats in the community, people that just grind for hours a day and getting a win streak as long as 50 digits of PI. There are the occasional noobs that you find, either being arbitrary or wholesome. Then there are toxic noobs, who have an ego the size of the Burj Khalifa.
On top of that, there are berating sweats who take the piss out of you for fun. The most everyday player you will find is just players. They go about their business, winning without soreness and losing with dignity. I don't know where to peg myself because sometimes I'm all over the place. But I mostly fit into the middle class.

What do you think is the most asked question in the community? If you can guess it, I'll carry you in bedwars. Welp, times up. The single most asked question is, "How good am I at pvp?" It's very tough to gauge your exact skill level because all players specialize in different areas. It's like challenging a cook to chess. You never know that he might be godly at it, competent, or horrendous, same with the pvp community. When someone asks that question, the asker sometimes starts to percolate with the excitement of a possible commendation on how well they are faring. Random players will answer it sight unseen, which to me makes no sense. How can you measure that, and how would they know? But, referring back to the previous paragraph, they might be one of those people.

Wooh. I am gassed. Maybe you enjoyed it, but if you didn't then, that's too bad. Go argue it out with some Masters division skywars player.
