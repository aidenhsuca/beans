Hello there. My name is beans and I'm going to sit here and write this essay because I need to write an essay and also to waste time. So um, while I'm here, I might as well talk about today. I had a pretty good day actually, and it is still pretty good because at the time of writing the day is still not over. My dad is gonna buy me a new mic because it's one that I've sought after for quite a bit of time now, it's cheap, and it's a good quality microphone. I might get back into making YouTube videos again, with the new equipment, and let's see how it goes. What's funny about my YouTube channel is that through almost no effort at all in the past 8-9 months that I have gotten to 50 subscribers, which is honestly amazing. Another new thing I've gotten into doing is just saying the word honk randomly. For example, one of my friends will just have discord open on the side while they're playing a game or just chilling, and then they'll randomly see a messages in a mutual server or messages that we have, and it'll just be me saying the word honk. It doesn't always have to be just normal honk, I can also vary it sometimes if it fancies me. Anyhow, my goal for this essay was at least 230 words, and seeing as I have surpassed that goal, I will now end it here. 

Bye, and until next time.
