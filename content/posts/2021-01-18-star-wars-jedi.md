Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is a single-player story game that takes you through the life of a Jedi named Cal Kestis, who was a padawan to Jedi Master Jaro Tapal, who was killed during the Jedi Purge, which led to Cal going into hiding and living alone, becoming a scrapper on Bracca, the planet which they were stationed on when Order 66 was issued.

Fallen Order has a very rich story, taking you back to when Cal was still training as a padawan through flashbacks during his journey to rebuild the Jedi Order. I can't say much about the game, as I have only seen videos on what is going to happen later on even though I'm still very new to all this. I had only started playing this recently, but I have enjoyed every moment of it thus far. I have been on 4 planets only, those being Bracca, Bogano, Zeffos, and Kashyyk. Right now, I am on Kashyyk helping the infamous rebel Saw Gerrera as he continues to resist the Empire. Before that, I've found a tomb of a sage on Zeffos, explored an ancient Jedi vault, and learned the basic controls on Bracca, where the game started. 

The game has this more or less unique feature called meditation circles, which are practically checkpoints. It also has 2 other options, such as Rest, which replenishes his health bar, and things like that. But the con is that all enemies respawn, so if there was a particularly tough enemy, such as a Purge Trooper, you will need to fight them again. It also has a skill tree, where you can spend skill points earned by fighting enemies and discovering things. The skill points can be spent on abilities like more health, advanced lightsaber combat techniques, and force abilities. There are just 3 categories I know of in the skill tree, and they are Force, Lightsaber, and Survival. 

So yeah, this has been me talking about Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order
