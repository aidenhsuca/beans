If aliens landed on Earth and they demanded to be taken to our leader I would suggest that we take them to either Elon Musk or Neil DeGrasse Tyson. I like those two candidates because Elon Musk is very interested in space exploration and Neil DeGrasse Tyson is a very well versed scientist, so I think either of those people would be able to communicate with them or something. I don’t know what they would actually do with the aliens, but since they came peacefully they might be able to extract information from them about space, where they came from, and things like that. Elon Musk would probably try to ask them how they got here and what kind of technology they possess back at their home or whatever. Neil on the other hand would probably try and find out where they live, how they live, how they evolved, etc. 

However, one person I wouldn’t bring the aliens to is probably Kim Jong-un. Kim Jong-un is the supreme leader of North Korea, and in other words a dictator. A really bad one. He keeps all the North Koreans under strict control and they can’t leave the country or have their own free will. Since they’re shown nothing in the media but propaganda, it’s safe to say that Kim Jong-un might also try something similar, which might turn the benevolent aliens into a more hostile group.
