Central Park  
  Central Park is an iconic New York park that I visited with my family on our trip to New York. It is quite a big park we only got to see some of, but the stuff we saw was pretty cool. During our day at the park, we saw performers and hawkers scattered throughout the place. 
Because there were lots of things to see, my dad booked a guided tour for us, and the tour guide took us from the park entrance and ended at the Bethesda Terrace, a structure overlooking a lake and the Angel of the Waters fountain. Besides walking around the park, we also went boating in Central Park's Lake. 

Food   
  The food in New York was exquisite. We mostly ate from street food vendors and restaurants. One time we had instant noodles in our hotel room. However, most of the trip consisted of pizza, burgers, sandwiches, etc. 
We ate a lot of different foods, but my favourite was pizza. I only remember one pizza I ate that was good. It was from a little pizza shop next to a subway station that we used called Union Street Pizza, aptly named after the subway station it was at, Union Street station.  
An honourable mention is Shake Shack because I liked their burgers and shakes, even if I got a little sick of the shake. 

American Museum of Natural History   
  It was a fascinating museum, much bigger than the ROM (Royal Ontario Museum), but I can't compare the two museums because they are different. 
(The AMNH (American Museum of Natural History) is dedicated to natural histories, like evolution, geology, space, dinosaurs, etc. However, the ROM has collections of things from around the world, like fossils, Chinese artifacts, Egyptian mummies, Roman and Greek architecture, an exhibit on Canadian First Nations, etc. Essentially, they are two very different museums, but I still like both.) 
There were a lot of realistic-looking models of animals, neanderthals, aquatic life, and bugs. There were even showcases of bugs, animals and early human life in their natural habitats, doing things they would've done. It's too bad I didn't get to fully enjoy it because I was sitting down most of the time due to pain from bug bites.

Jones Beach  
  Jones Beach is a beach on Long Island where we spent a day. I didn't fancy it because sand got everywhere and it was hot. The worse part about Jones Beach was the three painful bug bites I got that I had to ride out until the end of the trip. That pain held me back from exploring the AMNH. Jones Beach was the worst part of the trip for me, and I wouldn't do it again. I disliked it.

Brooklyn Bridge  
  The Brooklyn Bridge might've been my favourite part of the trip, besides one other thing will get to later. The walk across was pretty short and very calm, which made for a pleasant afternoon. The view from the bridge was stunning, as you could see Brooklyn's skyline and Manhattan's skyline, which look pretty cool when all the lights are on. 

  Times Square  
Times Square is probably one of the most iconic things in New York because it's in quite a few movies. Being at Times Square in person at night was awesome because all the billboards and lights lit up the place so well that it looked amazing. Standing in the centre and looking at the tall billboards was cool. It was also really crowded, but that didn't matter.

  Ferry  
The ferry we went on was also nice because the ride was smooth, plus the view of the setting sun was pleasant. The ferry was from Brooklyn to Manhattan (I think), and along the way, we got to see the Statue of Liberty at night while it was lit up, which was pretty cool. Even if I rode the ferry without seeing the Statue of Liberty, I would've enjoyed it anyway because it was relaxing and a nice break from all the walking and commuting we had to do in New York.
