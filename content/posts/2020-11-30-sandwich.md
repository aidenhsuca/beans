Ah, the majestic sandwich. It is a simple invention, but exquisite. The more known use for it is to consume and sate hunger, but there are other uses as well, such as a projectile in a food fight.

The sandwich originates from 18th-century Europe John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich. He was supposedly the inventor of the sandwich. However, the modern-day sandwich is named after Lord Sandwich, who was a constant gambler and didn't have time to eat proper meals, so he kept asking his servants to bring him slices of meat between two slices of bread. His gambling friends were well versed with this habit, so some of them started saying, "I'll have the same as Sandwich!", and thus the "sandwich" was born. 

Sandwiches are very easy to make, requiring little to no skill. I personally have done so numerous times.
