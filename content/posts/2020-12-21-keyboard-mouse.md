Today I will write a short little piece about my keyboard and mouse, and what impact they've had on me.

My keyboard and mouse are recent additions to my gaming setup, along with my headset, computer and mousepad. Before I got my keyboard and mouse, I was using my dad's crappy office peripherals to play Minecraft. It wasn't the best, but it worked. As time went on, I watched YouTube videos about gaming peripherals, such as the keyboard and mouse I have now. The ones I ended up buying is the Corsair K68 Mechanical Keyboard, with Cherry MX Red switches. My mouse is the Razer DeathAdder Elite. These peripherals have helped me win numerous amounts of games, no matter what I play. The senior of these is the DeathAdder, which I got last year as a birthday present. The keyboard was 
acquired in August of the same year, when I had grew to think my dad's Rosewill mechanical keyboard with blue switches intolerable. I prefer a quieter and less tactile keyboard as compared to a more tactile and clickier keyboard, while my dad preferred the latter. 

I really adore my keyboard and mouse, and every time I go to play video games I get excited because of the knowledge that my keyboard and mouse will enable me to have fun with my friends, or just alone. Whenever I am playing well with my keyboard and mouse, they don't feel like objects anymore. They feel like an extension of my body that will do what I will it to. And I think that's great, because that's what they're made to do.
