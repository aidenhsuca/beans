Discord is something I can't live	without. Prior to having a Discord account, talking to friends online had some difficulties and hindrances. Then on one fateful day, I asked my dad if I could sign up for Discord and download it on the computer so I could play Roblox with someone. He said yes. So, I went to the then named "discordapp.com" website for Discord, which is now simply "discord.com". I signed up with the name BlueLazerDad, which I still keep to this day. 

Discord is a VoIP, which means voice over internet protocol. I have no idea what this means personally, and I also do not know how that correlates with being able to talk with people. I guess the voice part makes a bit of sense, but I'm still in the dark. While I am writing this, my dad just came and told me that there is a rumour about Microsofting wanting to buy Discord. He also told me that Microsoft wants Discord because the problem with its other social media platforms is a lack of privacy. Discord adds a bit more to that end of the spectrum, with servers, direct messages, and private voice and text channels. And apparently, Microsoft already has an app called "Teams," which is a really crappy clone of another communication platform called "Slack."
But back to Microsoft wanting to purchase Discord. Discord has a net worth of 2.5 billion dollars, and Microsoft has a net worth of 1 trillion (I think). So that wouldn't put too much of a dent in Microsoft's banks. 

Discord is very, very good, and I recommend using it for everyone in the world. It used to be advertised for gamers, but a bit after the Covid-19 pandemic started, Discord started advertising it for everyday use instead of just for gamers. It can be a place for friends to just come together, have a movie night, or just chat. My class has a Discord server with 98% of people in it, and we've had movie nights in it, conversations, and I play talk to my friends in the voice channels on there daily. So yeah, Discord is pretty nice. 

Ok to be honest I have no idea where this essay was going. It was an impromptu idea that blossomed out of nowhere and had no connecting ideas. Well, now it's finished, so bye!
